## My Experience with Tailwind
- So far I have really enjoyed working with tailwind, its refreshing and I love how everything is short hand. I always had such an issue thinking about the syntax and now its reduced to a few letter.
- I also really enjoyed how easy it was to understand and use, I had a bit of trouble downloading some of the things to make my own font, I wish it was a little more intuitive but I'm sure with a little more use it will get faster.
## Attributions 
- I got a big chunk of my code from [Tailwind](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/components/navigation) I also added the custom css onto the last element in my page.
